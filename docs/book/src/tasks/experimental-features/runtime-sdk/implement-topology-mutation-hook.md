# Implementing Topology Mutation Hook Runtime Extensions

<aside class="note warning">

<h1>Caution</h1>

Please note Runtime SDK is an advanced feature. If implemented incorrectly, a failing Runtime Extension can severely impact the Cluster API runtime.

## Introduction

The Topology Mutation Hooks are going to be called during each Cluster topology reconciliation. More specifically 
we are going to call two different hooks for each reconciliation:

* **GeneratePatches**: GeneratePatches is responsible for generating patches for the entire Cluster topology.
* **ValidateTopology**: ValidateTopology is called after all patches have been applied and thus allow to validate 
  the resulting objects.

Please see the corresponding [CAEP](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220330-topology-mutation-hook.md)
for additional background information. 

## Inline vs. external patches

Inline patches have the following advantages:
* Inline patches are easier when getting started with ClusterClass as they are built into
  the Cluster API core controller, no external component have to be developed and managed. 

External patches have the following advantages:
* External patches can be individually written, unit tested and released/versioned.
* External patches can leverage the full feature set of a programming language and 
  are thus not limited to the capabilities of JSON patches and Go templating.
* External patches can use external data (e.g. from cloud APIs) during patch generation.
* External patches can be easily reused across ClusterClasses.

## Using one or multiple external patch extensions

Some considerations:
* In general a single external patch extension is simpler than many, as only one extension 
  then has to be built, deployed and managed. 
* A single extension also requires less HTTP round-trips between the CAPI controller and the extension(s).
* With a single extension it is still possible to implement multiple logical features using different variables.
* When implementing multiple logical features in one extension it's recommended that they can be conditionally
  enabled/disabled via variables (either via certain values or by their existence).
* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) might make it not feasible in large organizations 
  to use a single extension. In those cases it's important that boundaries between extensions are clearly defined.

## Guidelines

For general Runtime Extension developer guidelines please refer to the guidelines in [Implementing Runtime Extensions](implement-extensions.md#guidelines).
This section outlines considerations specific to Topology Mutation hooks:

* **Input validation**: An External Patch Extension must always validate its input, i.e. it must validate that
  all variables exist, have the right type and it must validate the kind and apiVersion of the templates which
  should be patched.
* **Timeouts**: As External Patch Extensions are called during each Cluster topology reconciliation, they must
  respond as fast as possible (&lt;=200ms) to avoid delaying individual reconciles and congestion.
* **Availability**: An External Patch Extension must be always available, otherwise Cluster topologies wonâ€™t be
  reconciled anymore.
* **Side Effects**: An External Patch Extension must not make out-of-band changes. If necessary external data can
  be retrieved, but be aware of performance impact.
* **Deterministic results**: For a given request (a set of templates and variables) an External Patch Extension must
  always return the same response (a set of patches). Otherwise the Cluster topology will never reach a stable state.
* **Idempotence**: An External Patch Extension must only return patches if changes to the templates are required,
  i.e. unnecessary patches when the template is already in the desired state must be avoided.
* **Avoid Dependencies**: An External Patch Extension must be independent of other External Patch Extensions. However
  if dependencies cannot be avoided, it is possible to control the order in which patches are executed via the ClusterClass.

## Definitions

### GeneratePatches

A GeneratePatches call generates patches for the entire Cluster topology. Accordingly the request contains all
templates, the global variables and the template-specific variables. The response contains generated patches.

#### Example request:

* Generating patches for a Cluster topology is done via a single call to allow External Patch Extensions a
  holistic view of the entire Cluster topology. Additionally this allows us to reduce the number of round-trips.
* Each item in the request will contain the template as a raw object. Additionally information about where
  the template is used is provided via `holderReference`.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: GeneratePatchesRequest
variables:
- name: <variable-name>
  value: <variable-value>
  ...
items:
- uid: 7091de79-e26c-4af5-8be3-071bc4b102c9
  holderReference:
    apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: MachineDeployment
    namespace: default
    name: cluster-md1-xyz
    fieldPath: spec.template.spec.infrastructureRef
  object:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: AWSMachineTemplate
    spec:
    ...
  variables:
  - name: <variable-name>
    value: <variable-value>
    ...
```

#### Example Response:

* The response contains patches instead of full objects to reduce the payload.
* Templates in the request and patches in the response will be correlated via UIDs.
* Like inline patches, external patches are only allowed to change fields in `spec.template.spec`.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: GeneratePatchesResponse
status: Success # or Failure
message: "error message if status == Failure"
items:
- uid: 7091de79-e26c-4af5-8be3-071bc4b102c9
  patchType: JSONPatch
  patch: <JSON-patch>
```

We are considering to introduce a library to facilitate development of External Patch Extensions. It would provide capabilities like:
* Accessing builtin variables
* Extracting certain templates from a GeneratePatches request (e.g. all bootstrap templates)

If you are interested in contributing to this library please reach out to the maintainer team or
feel free to open an issue describing your idea or use case.

### ValidateTopology

A ValidateTopology call validates the topology after all patches have been applied. The request contains all 
templates of the Cluster topology, the global variables and the template-specific variables. The response
contains the result of the validation.

#### Example Request:

* The request is the same as the GeneratePatches request except it doesn't have `uid` fields. We don't
  need them as we don't have to correlate patches in the response.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidateTopologyRequest
variables:
- name: <variable-name>
  value: <variable-value>
  ...
items:
- holderReference:
    apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: MachineDeployment
    namespace: default
    name: cluster-md1-xyz
    fieldPath: spec.template.spec.infrastructureRef
  object:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: AWSMachineTemplate
    spec:
    ...
  variables:
  - name: <variable-name>
    value: <variable-value>
    ...
```

#### Example Response:

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidateTopologyResponse
status: Success # or Failure
message: "error message if status == Failure"
```
